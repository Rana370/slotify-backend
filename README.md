##  Project Description

Slotify is a smart parking reservation platform designed to simplify the way you find and book parking. Whether you're heading to work, shopping, or an event, Slotify lets you reserve your parking space in advance, saving you time, reducing stress, and helping you avoid the hassle of circling around.

With just a few clicks, users can view available slots in real-time, choose the most convenient location, and secure their spot instantly. Our mission is to make urban parking effortless by combining intuitive design with reliable, up-to-date information.

Slotify is built with convenience in mind, so your parking is one less thing to worry about.

## Story 

Users can register on the Slotify platform by providing a username, email, and password. Once registered and logged in, users can browse available garages and view open parking spots. They can reserve spots, as well as create, view, update, and cancel their own reservations. Additionally, users have full control over their vehicles, with the ability to add, edit, or delete vehicle details. Company administrators have access to manage garage facilities and oversee reservation activity. The admin interface is being designed to resemble the SDA management system, offering a more intuitive and structured experience for administrative users.
